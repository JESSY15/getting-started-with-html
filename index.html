    <h1>Important basic Concepts --Stage 0</h1>
<!--modified from Andy's notes-->
<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. It consists of three major pieces.
  <br>
  <b> 1.</b>web browser
  <br><b>2.</b>Internet
  <br><b>3.</b>severs
  <br>When a person goes to a web page like <a href='www.google.com'>google</a>, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em> via <em>Internet</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em><br>
Document form the majority of the content on the web. <br>HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".<br>
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. Most of the tags including both opening tag and closing tag, however, some of the tags do not require closing tag,
  also called <b>'void'</b> tags.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  <em>literally</em>. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. <strong>Inline Elements</strong> occupy the same line if there is space. However, <strong>Block  Elements</strong> take up a full line each. And block elements form an "invisible box" around the content
  inside of them.
</p>
<!--I would like to use the <b> and <strong> in the html. However,it is not possible to directly use <b> or <strong> as it will always been displayed as bold. I googled and found the escape code for <b> is &lt;b&gt; and escape code for <strong> is &lt;strong&gt;. This website is helpful in finding the escape code for html. http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/developer-tools/quick-escape/default.php
I wonder does most, if not every, escape code looks the same?(&lt;X&gt)-->
<b>Difference between the element &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt;</b>

<p>Both Elements have the same effect on web browser. However, they are different in many ways. This <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271743/whats-the-difference-between-b-and-strong-i-and-em'>post</a> explains it well.
  
  <br>&lt;b&gt; is a style - make content "bold" .<br>

&lt;strong&gt; however is an indication of how something should be understood. "Strong" could (and often does) mean "bold" in a browser, but it could also mean a lower tone for a speaking program like Jaws (for blind people). And strong on a Palm Pilot may be an underline. 
  (see detailed explaination in the above mentioned <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271743/whats-the-difference-between-b-and-strong-i-and-em'>post</a> ) </P>
